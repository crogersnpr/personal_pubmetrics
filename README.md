# personal_pubmetrics
Personal files for pubmetrics data
April 2020 is edited from Christina's r script. It was to run April 2020 data as an addendum to Spring 2020 pubmetrics
due to covid19 trends from Q1 '20 needed additional April data in order to provide action items for stations
this script pulls one month of data using cohorts of stations defined by the past data
static cohorts are in this repos
this could possibly be used so that past data doesnt have to be rerun for every pubmetrics as long as the cohort has been consistent since the last pubmetrics
