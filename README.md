## Personal pubmetrics scripts and station cohorts

'April 2020 R' is edited from Christina's r script. It was to run April 2020 data as an addendum to Spring 2020 pubmetrics
due to covid19 trends. Q1 '20 needed additional April data in order to provide action items for stations.
This script pulls one month of data using cohorts of stations defined by original pulls from Jan '15 to March '20
Static cohorts from that time are in this repos in case this script needs to be run without the original dataframes loaded.
This could possibly be used in the future so that past data doesnt have to be rerun for every pubmetrics as long as the cohort has been consistent since the last pubmetrics.
